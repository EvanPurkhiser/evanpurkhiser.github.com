Hi there! My name's Evan. I'm a software developer who takes a special interest
in building applications for the web. I absolutely love writing clean,
understandable, and maintainable code to solve interesting problems (I know, I
get excited easily). I also like to think I have an eye for clean and usable
design, but usually find myself in awe over the subtle details in the shots from
[Dribble](http://dribbble.com).

When I'm not at a keyboard you can find me down on the dance floor bouncing
around to, or [even spinning](https://soundcloud.com/evanpurkhiser), some of my
favorite genres of music: [UK Hardcore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_hardcore)
and [Uplifting Trance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uplifting_trance). Of
course, outside of dancing you'll find me at the gym, spending time with my
friends, and getting excited about my next trip.
