Hi there! My name's Evan. I'm a software developer who takes a special interest
in building applications for the web. I absolutely love writing clean,
understandable, and maintainable code to solve interesting problems (I know, I
get excited easily). I also like to think I have an eye for clean and usable
design, but usually find myself in awe over the subtle details in the shots from
[Dribble](http://dribbble.com).

When I'm not solving problems you can find me out on the dance floor jamming
out or [spinning](https://soundcloud.com/evanpurkhiser) my favorite genres of
music, [UK Hardcore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_hardcore) and [Uplifting
Trance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uplifting_trance). But most likely, you'll
find me spending time with my friends watching whatever we can find on Netflix.
