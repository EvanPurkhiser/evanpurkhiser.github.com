Hi there! My name's Evan. I'm a software developer who takes a special interest
in building applications for the web. I absolutely love writing clean,
understandable, and maintainable code to solve interesting problems (I know, I
get excited easily). I also like to think I have an eye for clean and usable
design, but usually find myself in awe over the subtle details in the shots from
[Dribble](http://dribbble.com).

When I'm not solving problems you can find me out on the dance floor jamming
out or [spinning](http://evanpurkhiser.com/mixes) my favorite genres of music,
[UK Hardcore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_hardcore) and [Uplifting
Trance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uplifting_trance). But most likely, you'll
find me spending time with my friends watching whatever we can find on Netflix.
