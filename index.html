		Hi there! My name's Evan. I'm a software developer who takes a special interest in building applications
		for the web. I absolutely love writing clean, understandable, and maintainable code to solve interesting
		problems (I know, I get excited easily). I also like to think I have an eye for clean and usable design,
		but usually find myself in awe over the subtle details in the shots from
		<a href="http://dribbble.com">Dribbble</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I'm not solving problems you can find me out on the dance floor enjoying my favorite
		genre of music, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_hardcore">UK Hardcore</a>. But most likely,
		you'll find me spending time with my firlenids watching whatever we can find on Netflix.
