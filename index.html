				Hi there! My name's Evan. I'm a software developer who takes a special interest in building applications
				for the web. I absolutely love writing clean, understandable, and maintainable code to solve interesting
				problems (I know, I get excited easily). I also like to think I have an eye for clean and usable design,
				but usually find myself in awe over the subtle details in the shots from
				<a href="http://dribbble.com">Dribbble</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I'm not solving problems you can find me out on the dance floor enjoying my favorite
				genera of music, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_hardcore">UK Hardcore</a>. But most likely,
				you'll find me spending time with my friends watching whatever we can find on Netflix.
			</p>

				Check me out on a <a href="https://github.com/evanpurkhiser">GitHub</a> or email me at
				<a href="mailto:evanpurkhiser@gmail.com">evanpurkhiser@gmail.com</a>.
